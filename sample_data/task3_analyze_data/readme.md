# Task description
In this task you can explore pucli transport stations in Helsinki region and perform basic GIS operations (buffers, intersects) with them.  
You should add all the vector layers to your project by following the instructors instructions. First you should explore the spatial relationship between the pubs, bars and restaurants and the public transport stops. To create a correct buffer for the stops, you need to reproject them. You can do this with Processing toolbox Reprojection tool. After your layer is reprojected, you can use the Buffer tool to create a 200 meter buffer around the stops. After this you should select the OpenStreetMap bars and pubs that are within this distance from the stops and analyze the data in the way you see most informative (e.g. Join attributes by location and create a thematic map).  

OSM bars, restaurants and pubs collected from Geofabrik. Â© OpenStreetMap contributors. 

Public transport data was downloaded [here](https://hri.fi/data/dataset/hsl-n-nousijamaarat-pysakeittain).

You can find a detailed explanation of the process of buffers and spatial relationships [here](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/performing_spatial_queries.html).
