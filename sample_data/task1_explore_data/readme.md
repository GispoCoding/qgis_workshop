# Task description
Purpose of this task is to get familiar with basic functionalities of QGIS and the user interface. You should add the Natural Earth Shapefile containing countries to the QGIS canvas using Data Source Manager. You should also explore the attributes of the file and change the style of the file. 

You can find instructions for basic vector styling [here](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/basic_vector_styling.html).

What is a Shapefile and what are the other files that come with it? It's probably the most established vector format in GIS. It has some obvious problems (size limit, NULL handling etc.), but it is very important to know how to handle themm. You can read more about it from [Mapschool.io](https://mapschool.io/).
