# Task description
In the final task we will create a cartogram using the Cartogram3 plugin in QGIS. We will use the election result data from the parliamentary elections in 2019 that has been already joined with the population data.

Data originated from [Statistics Finland](http://www.stat.fi/org/avoindata/paikkatietoaineistot_en.html).  

A lengthy and detailed step-by-step guide on how to do a table join can be found [here](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/performing_table_joins.html)
