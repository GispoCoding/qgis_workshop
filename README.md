# QGIS tutorial
Want to get started with QGIS, but have no clue what to do?? You're in the right place! 

Originally created for a QGIS workshop held for students in Amsterdam in December 2019, but the materials are open for everyone to use/copy/improve.  

There are three basic tasks with instructions and sample data in the sample_data folder. They do not contain step by step instructions for each, but will give you the necessary input data and a brief description of steps you need to take to do the tasks.
